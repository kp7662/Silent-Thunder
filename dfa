Textual DFA
Author: Kok Wei Pua

Note that:
- A DFA consists of states and transitions.
- Each transition is labeled with exactly one character or character set.
- In a DFA the next state is a function of the current state and the current character. 
    The next state is a function of *only* the current state and the current character.
- A DFA indicates which state is the START state.
- A DFA indicates whether each state is an accepting state or a rejecting state.
